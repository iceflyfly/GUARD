# GUARD
Android Platform-Based Mobile Phone Anti-Lost Alert APP. 
Smart anti-theft detection based on mobile phone recognition.
Designed a data collector that captures 300-dimensional data based on changes in threshold outputs by mobile phone light sensors.
Training with a backpropogation (BP) neural network to obtain the classification model. Used Joone(Java open source neural network package) to complete the training and optimization of the neural network. 
Trained data from 8,000 300-dimensional samples to achieve 97.5% training accuracy and 83% actual recognition rate.
